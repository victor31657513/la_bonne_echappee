# Guidelines

- Lint the code with `npm run lint` and run tests with `npm test` whenever source code inside `src/` changes.
- Tests and lint are not required for documentation-only edits.
- Relay intervals scale with the number of riders currently in the relay queue.
  Riders too éloignés chase to join but do not affect the interval.
